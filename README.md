## I'm an Information Science student in College Park, MD, with a passion for networking and cloud computing, seeking opportunities to grow my technical skills. Welcome to my portfolio! In the future I have a few goals for this page:
* Showcase labs and trainings that I've worked on while studying for certifications
* Describe my experience gaining IT certs, which study techniques I used, and which skills transfer to my jobs
* Showcase programming and scripting projects that I've completed (once I get to that level)

My journey in information science has led me to develop a passion for computers, and I am excited to transition into this field. I aspire to become a Cloud Engineer or Network Engineer, using my skills to work on cloud and network infrastructures.
