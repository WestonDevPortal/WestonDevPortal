## I'm an Information Science student in College Park, MD, with a passion for networking and cloud computing, seeking opportunities to grow my technical skills. Welcome to my portfolio! In the future I have a few goals for this page:
* Showcase labs and trainings that I've worked on while studying for certifications
* Describe my experience gaining IT certs, which study techniques I used, and which skills transfer to my jobs
* Showcase programming and scripting projects that I've completed (once I get to that level)

Driven by my studies in information science and a strong interest in technology, I aim to become a Cloud Engineer or Network Engineer, seeking opportunities to grow and collaborate with teams in building and optimizing cloud and network systems.
